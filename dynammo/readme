run:

System requirement:

Description:

Find attached perl scripts (from Jim):

c3d_to_csv.pl -> which can convert .c3d files into .csv files with labeled
column headers. (Useful for getting mocap data into matlab.)

csv_into_c3d.pl -> which can update the data in a c3d file to match a csv
file (useful for importing back into vicon).

remove_markers.pl -> trim out markers from a csv file given names and
ranges. Useful for creating testing data by hand.

These are from my svn repository, revision 1882 (I write this here so if I
update, I'll know what version I sent you!).
